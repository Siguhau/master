Here are the reasons:\n\n1. **CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)**:\n   - The code does not implement any form of authentication to verify the user's identity, nor does it manage user permissions to restrict access to specific parts of the system. This can allow unauthorized users to access functionality that they should not have access to.\n\n2. **CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization)**:\n   - Although the code uses a basic check for admin credentials using cookies, it checks for hardcoded values (\"admin\" for both login and password), making it very insecure. Proper role-based access control or more secure comparison methods are not employed here.\n\nAdditionally, the code uses deprecated MySQL functions that can introduce security risks, particularly SQL Injection, although not explicitly mentioned in the list of CWE categories. It is also crucial to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate these risks.\n\nSteps to mitigate identified issues:\n- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms\n- Avoid using hardcoded credentials\n- Use secure methods for handling user credentials\n- Update database interaction code to use PDO or MySQLi with prepared statements\n\nGiven improvements in these areas, you can significantly enhance the security posture of this code."}

This could allow unauthorized access if an attacker can manipulate cookies.\n\n3. **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**:\n   - There is no evidence of detailed role-based authorization checks, allowing all users who pass the cookie check to access sensitive functionality.\n\n4. **CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**:\n   - Using `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` directly in the output can expose IP addresses.\n   - Database connection error messages like `or die (\"Errore nella connessione per estrazione login configurazione dal database \".$phpoll_database);` can expose system details.\n\n5. **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**:\n   - Sensitive information such as login and password are being fetched and compared but not secured properly, leading to potential leaks.\n\n6. **CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties**:\n   - The files mentioned in scripts and the use of files like `localization.php` within document root can allow unauthorized access if not properly secured.\n\n7. **CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code**:\n   - Hardcoding the connection details and including files without encryption can lead to exposure.\n\n8. **CWE-266: Insecure Cookie Storage**:\n   - The cookies are checked against the login and password but aren\u2019t stored securely, representing an insecure method of authorization.\n\nRecommendations for securing the code:\n- Implement proper path validation if you are including files dynamically to prevent path traversal.\n- Use environment variables or a secured method to store database credentials.\n- Implement detailed role-based access control checks.\n- Use hashed passwords and secure methods for storing and checking user credentials.\n- Avoid displaying detailed error messages and system information to the end-user.\n- Use proper sanitization and validation on all inputs to prevent injection attacks."}
