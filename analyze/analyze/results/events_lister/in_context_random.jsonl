Here are the specific CWEs identified:\n\n1. **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor**\n   - The code exposes the username via the `$uname` variable, which might be sensitive.\n\n2. **CWE-284: Improper Access Control & CWE-285: Improper Authorization**\n   - The code only checks if the user's username is the same as the session username before proceeding with deletion. It doesn't perform adequate authorization checks.\n\n3. **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') & CWE-23: Relative Path Traversal**\n   - Although not very apparent in the code snippet, if user input is not properly sanitized in the `common.php` or `config.php` files, those inputs could potentially be used to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**\n   - The delete action is carried out via a POST request without any CSRF protection tokens, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\n\n5. **CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration**\n   - Although not evident within the provided code snippet, improper session management can lead to potential unauthorized access.\n\n6. **CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive System Information to an Unauthorized Control Sphere**\n   - Error messages printed using `die` and `mysql_error` can leak sensitive configuration details to unauthorized users.\n\nHere\u2019s a more secure example to fix some of these issues:\n\n```php\n<?php\nrequire('common.php');\n$un = $_SESSION['userName'];\ncheckUser();\n\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST' && isset($_POST['csrf_token']) && hash_equals($_SESSION['csrf_token'], $_POST['csrf_token'])) {\n    $ud_id = $_POST['ud_id'] ??
