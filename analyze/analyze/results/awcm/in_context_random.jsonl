If proper checks are not employed, an exposed SQL query could leak sensitive data from the database.\n\n4. **CWE-284 Improper Access Control** and **CWE-285 Improper Authorization** and **CWE-862 Missing Authorization** and **CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization**:\n    - The check `if($mysql_maininfo_row['members_on'] == 'on' AND $member !== no OR $member_level == 'admin')` contains logical flaws. The `OR $member_level == 'admin'` can bypass other checks and allow unintended access.\n\n5. **CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:\n    - The code does not include any mechanism to prevent CSRF attacks. Simply submitting the form post request could be vulnerable to CSRF.\n\n6. **CWE-359 Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor**:\n    - Potential exposure through printed messages and responses for failed or successful operations.\n\n7. **CWE-377 Insecure Temporary File**:\n    - Not directly related to a temporary file, but creating a file or storing data without proper access checks and security mechanisms might introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n8. **CWE-424 Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**:\n    - Improper authorization checks might lead to forced browsing vulnerabilities, allowing an unauthorized user to access restricted areas of the application if they know the endpoint.\n\n9. **CWE-566 Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled SQL Primary Key**:\n    - There is SQL involving `$pcat` which looks user-provided. If a user can control these inputs directly, they might bypass access controls.\n\n10. **CWE-601 URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')**:\n    - The script includes a redirection logic: `print '<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0;URL=notify.php?v=done_i';`. If `$autoactivate` was improperly managed, it might lead to an open redirect case.\n\n11. **CWE-706 Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference**:\n    - Incorrectly-resolved filenames or paths in includes based on user input or constructs.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\n- **SQL Injection**: The usage of `mysql_query` without proper sanitization opens the code to SQL injection (`$ptitle`, `$pshort_desc`, `$pcat`, etc. are used in SQL queries without parameterized queries).\n\nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should validate and sanitize user inputs, employ prepared statements, enforce strict access control, implement CSRF tokens, and carefully manage redirections and file inclusions. Additionally, consider using modern techniques and libraries which inherently provide better security."}
